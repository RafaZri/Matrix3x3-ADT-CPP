# Matrix3x3-ADT-CPP

## Overview
This project implements a 3x3 matrix abstract data type (ADT) in C++. The Matrix3x3 ADT supports various matrix operations through operator overloading, making it user-friendly for mathematical applications.

## Features
- **Basic Matrix Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scalar operations.
- **Advanced Calculations**: Determinant, transpose, inverse, and more.
- **Operator Overloading**: Intuitive syntax for matrix operations with overloaded operators.
- **Error Handling**: Handles cases like division by zero and non-invertible matrices.

## Building the Project
This project uses CMake for building. To compile:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
